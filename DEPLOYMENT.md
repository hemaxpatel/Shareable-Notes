# Deployment Guide for Shareable Notes

## Quick Deployment Options

### 1. Netlify (Recommended)

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
3. Your app will be live instantly!

**Or using Netlify CLI:**

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### 2. Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel --prod`
3. Follow the prompts

### 3. GitHub Pages

1. Install gh-pages: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. Add to package.json scripts:
   ```json
   "predeploy": "npm run build",
   "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   ```
3. Run: `npm run deploy`

### 4. Local Testing

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Build Configuration

The project is configured with Vite for optimal production builds:

- **Minification**: Enabled
- **Tree Shaking**: Automatic
- **Asset Optimization**: Images and icons optimized
- **Bundle Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for better loading

## Environment Variables

No environment variables required - the app runs entirely client-side with local storage.

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- **Features Used**: ES6+, CSS Grid, Flexbox, LocalStorage, Crypto API
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading for components
- Debounced auto-save (1 second)
- Efficient search algorithms
- Optimized re-renders with React hooks
- Compressed assets and minimal bundle size

## Security Features

- Client-side AES encryption for sensitive notes
- No data transmission - fully offline application
- Password validation and strength checking
- Secure local storage practices

## Hosting Requirements

- **Static Hosting**: Any static file hosting service
- **No Backend**: Pure frontend application
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage (no external database)
- **SSL**: Recommended for production (most hosting providers include this)

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Test all features in production environment
- [ ] Verify responsive design on different devices
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption functionality
- [ ] Confirm AI features work correctly
- [ ] Test export/import functionality
- [ ] Verify keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Check search highlighting
- [ ] Test glossary hover tooltips

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **White screen**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. **Features not working**: Ensure modern browser compatibility
3. **Data not persisting**: Check if LocalStorage is enabled
4. **Responsive issues**: Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools

### Debug Mode:

Open browser console and type:

```javascript
// Load demo data
demoData.loadDemoData();

// Show feature demonstrations
demoData.demonstrateFeatures.showAIInsights();
demoData.demonstrateFeatures.showEncryption();
```

## Analytics and Monitoring

Since this is a client-side only application, consider adding:

- Google Analytics for usage tracking
- Error monitoring with Sentry
- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals

## Backup and Recovery

Users can:

- Export notes as JSON files
- Import previously exported notes
- Data persists in browser LocalStorage
- Recommend users to export regularly for backup
